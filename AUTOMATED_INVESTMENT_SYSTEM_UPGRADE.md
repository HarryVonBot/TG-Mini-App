## üéØ **System Overview**

### **Current Manual Process:**
1. User commits to investment ‚Üí Status: "pending"
2. User sends crypto ‚Üí VonVault Trust Wallet (`0x1cB7111eBBF79Af5E941eB89B8eAFC67830be8a4`)
3. **Manual Process:** Transfer crypto to exchange
4. **Manual Process:** Convert crypto to fiat
5. **Manual Process:** Deposit fiat for real investment
6. **Manual Process:** Update investment status to "active"

### **New Automated Process:**
1. User commits to investment ‚Üí Status: "pending"
2. User sends crypto ‚Üí VonVault Trust Wallet
3. **Automated:** Blockchain monitor detects deposit ‚Üí Status: "crypto_received"
4. **Automated:** Transfer crypto to exchange ‚Üí Status: "converting"
5. **Automated:** Exchange converts crypto to fiat
6. **Automated:** Investment activation ‚Üí Status: "active" + Lock period begins
7. **Automated:** User notifications and timeline tracking
